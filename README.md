# RPCBot
Removed Posts Counter Bot

The purpose of the bot is to keep track of the number of removed posts of an user in a subreddit. When the threshold is reached, the bot sends a mail to mods with a message including the username and number of removed posts. For any queries contact me [here](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=QuantumBrute&subject).
